      The ocean is calm and clear. It contains a lot of fish. (Great for sashimi!) Snorkeling would be awesome in the ocean if I had thought to include that in my 5 necessities. Fortunately, I have built a fishing rod out of some branches and my hair.

      It is very bright and sunny here. Good thing, I remembered sunscreen! I am still probably going to be very dark-skinned and probably sun-burnt by the end of my time here. Especially if I run out of sunscreen.

      There is a dormant volcano here. But thankfully, IT IS DORMANT. Please pray that it remains so. I have heard that it erupts in months with the letter r in them. I hope this month doesn't have an r. I would not survive a volcanic event.

      Parrots seem to flourish here. They're not very nice. Many they're just copying me, though? Or is it.... Gordon Ramsey? Occassionally, dolphins swim by. Near the shore. I wonder if they're nice.
